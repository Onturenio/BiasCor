This is a set of tools that are companions of the paper discussed at https://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2017-329/

The repository contains two types of resources:
 - Bash scripts: that are _the glue_ of **CDO**, **GMT** and other shell commands (**awk**, **cat**, **grep**, etc)
 - Fortran programs: that actually perform the calculation

Running these programs requires having the right input data, which is available upon request at my email: jjgomeznavavrro@um.es
